# Temperature Logs 

A simple Python project that reads a list of daily temperatures from a file, calculates the average temperature and the coldest day, and writes the results to an output file.

## Files

- `process.py`: The main Python script
- `input.txt`: Contains sample temperature data
- `output.txt`: The result file created after running the script
- `run_script.sh`: Shell script to execute the program
- `development_doc.txt`: Documentation of the project

## How to Run

```bash
./run_script.sh
